            <h2>About Me</h2>
            

            <p>Hello, my name is Guy Carter-Richardson. I am interested in exploring nature and understanding
                 developments in science when they're made. Having studied physics previously, I love
                developing my understanding of the laws that govern matter, energy, space and time.
            </p>

            <p>I completed my undergraduate and masters studies in Physics at Swansea University, where I actively
                participated in various research projects and gained valuable insights into experimental and theoretical
                aspects of physics. These experiences only intensified my passion for the subject, and I am now eager to
                take my knowledge and skills to the next level by pursuing a Ph.D. in Physics.</p>

            <h2>Why I Want to Pursue a Ph.D. in Physics</h2>
            <p>I am particularly interested in
                exploring topics such as quantum mechanics, cosmology, and high-energy particle physics.</p>

            <p>I am excited about the potential to conduct new research, collaborate with
                researchers, and be part of a vibrant academic community. The opportunity to unravel the complexities of
                the universe through rigorous scientific inquiry is an exciting opportunity that I hope to begin in the 
                coming 12 months.</p>

            <p>Moreover, I am eager to engage in teaching and mentorship, as I believe that sharing knowledge and
                inspiring the next generation of physicists is a crucial aspect of academic growth and progress.</p>
