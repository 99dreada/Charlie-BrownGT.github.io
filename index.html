            <p>Additionally, I'm deeply committed to promoting inclusivity and diversity in the scientific 
                community. Through my experiences and encounters, I hope to share stories that shed light on 
                the importance of embracing a wide range of voices and perspectives within the field of 
                physics.
            </p>
