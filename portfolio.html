        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a passionate and dedicated web developer and designer, with a strong flair for creating engaging and user-friendly experiences on the web. My journey in the world of technology began with a deep fascination for the way websites and applications work, and it has grown into a fulfilling career that I'm truly passionate about.
            My curiosity and eagerness to learn have driven me to continually explore new technologies and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. I take great pride in crafting clean, efficient, and visually appealing code that not only meets the functional requirements but also delights users with seamless interactions.
            In addition to my technical skills, I believe in the power of collaboration and communication. Working with diverse teams and understanding the unique perspectives of individuals has taught me the importance of effective teamwork in achieving outstanding results.
            When I'm not immersed in coding and design, you'll likely find me indulging in various creative pursuits, such as photography, illustration, or writing. Nature and traveling also hold a special place in my heart, as they continuously inspire and refresh my creative spirit.
            This portfolio serves as a showcase of my work and a glimpse into my passion for creating meaningful digital experiences. Feel free to explore my projects, and if you'd like to collaborate or simply have a chat, don't hesitate to reach out through the contact information provided.
            Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy your time here!

            <h4>
                Project 1 - building a cloud chamber. 
            </h4>
            <p>This project initially seeks to build a home cloud chamber that can be used to detect the presence
                of background particles using equipment that can be easily sourced through conventional chains. 
            </p>
            <h5>Research</h5>
            <p>Initially there are several stands of work, these include research and design. Here I will list any
                 resources used and detail the design process. 
                SketchUp will be used to draft initial chamber designs. Free online materials will be used to produce 
                planning guidance. The video linked in the following has been used as an initial starting point
