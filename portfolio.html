        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
           I intend to use this section to document projects I'm working through to enable others to enjoy 
           the same results. These will be split broadly into physics, computing and gardening projects with 
           a smattering of others thrown in when they occur. If any part of the following is unclear, please 
           direct any enquiries to me directly via the 'Contact' page. Happy reading.

            <h4>
                Project 1 - building a cloud chamber. 
            </h4>
            <p>This project initially seeks to build a home cloud chamber that can be used to detect the presence
                of cosmic particles using equipment that can be easily sourced through conventional chains. 
            </p>
            <h4>Research</h4>
            <p>Begining with a research phase, all the resources accessed here are open source. Any number of videos 
                were used for reference. 
                 <a href="https://app.sketchup.com/app?hl=en">SketchUp</a> will be used to draft initial chamber designs. Free online materials will be used to produce 
                planning guidance. The video linked in the following has been used as an initial starting point 
                <a href="https://home.cern/news/news/experiments/how-make-your-own-cloud-chamber">Cloud Chamber Video 1</a>
            </p>
            <h4>Materials</h4>
            <p>
            The materials required to construct this cloud chamber are:
            <ul>
                <li>1.  Heat sink</li>
                <li>2.  Isopropyl alcohol</li>
                <li>3.  Felt</li>
                <li>4.  Aluminium tape</li>
                <li>5.  Warm vessel</li>
                <li>6.  Torch</li>
                <li>7.  Cold vessel</li>
                <li>8.  Kettle</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The physics behind this projects stems from the presence of background particles consistently generated throughout 
                our lives. Typically these are uncharged and pass through the earth and without detection
                or interaction. Ranging in makeup but including both leptons and hadrons, these can be detected
                using the following. The idea is to create a vessel that contains a heat gradient between warm 
                and cold sources. From there, a felt cloth is soaked in Isopropyl and placed in contact with the 
                warm heat source. Noting the low evaporating temperature of Isoproyl, this vaporizes and is contained
                within a chamber. At the opposite side of the chamber to the felt, the heat sink (maintaining a 
                significantly reduced temperature) cools the vaporized alcohol and creates a state of near imbalance
                within the vapor. Any perturbation to the vapour causes the droplets surrounding the perturbation
                to condense and creates a vapour trail - similar to that seen from a plane in flight. The particles mentioned
                 previously flow through the chamber, causing this disturbance and creating a vapour trail. These 
                 are the trails I intend to observe within this project. 
            </p>

            <p>
                If successful there will be a second stage to this project where I intend to introduce a magnetic field 
                across the chamber to create an observable curvature impacting any charged aprticles present.

                Project 1 - building a home server stack.
            </h4>
            <p>
                During this project I intend to create a server stack for domestic use. This will host a variety of 
                simple services including file sharing and a web host. Sourcing generally second hand hardware, I hope 
                to keep costs reasonable. If successful in this first step, I plan to extend the services hosted to 
                include an email host.

                Project 2 - re-learning Python.
            </h4>
            <p>
                Having spent the last few years away from coding I have started to work through some small coding 
                projects to re-learn some old skills. Several of these are detailed in the following: 
            </p>
            <h4>
                Computing an approximation of Pi.
            </h4>
            <p>
                A simple script to compute Pi can be found in the following link <a href="https://github.com/Charlie-BrownGT/Python/blob/main/pi_computation.py">Pi Computation</a>. 
                Please note, the variable titled 'points_used' will dictate the precision to which the end result is calculated. 
                The more points used, the greater the precision. 
            </p>
            <h4>
                Producing a hangman game.
            </h4>
            <p>
                The next mini project was to produce a game of hangman that can be executed directly from the console. 
                The code for this programme can be found on my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Charlie-BrownGT/Python/blob/main/hangman_game.py">Hangman Game</a>. 
                The next step here will be to create a randomised word generator to make the game more playable. 
                I plan to update this over the coming days.

            <h3>Gardening Projects</h3>

            <p> 
                Alongside the projects already mentioned, I am also interested in gardening and horticulture, particularly 
                observing plants in nature and observing how they grow. Here I seek to document the growth of plants local 
                to me and attempt to document/classify their species.
